# Manual-SGD-implementation-for-Linear-regression
The motive of this notebook is to implement Stochastic gradient descent from scratch and compare the results with SKLearn's implementation of SGD. This helps one to understand the how SGD works internally.

In order to keep it simple, I have chosen Linear regression we can easily extend this to other algorithms.
